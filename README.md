# TriviaMaze

Class project for CSCD 350 - Software Engineering

  Project Focused on the software lifecycle more than the actual code.
  Team project originally managed using a different git repo that I don't control. 
  Agile development principles used with Pivotal Tracker used to manage workflow.
  
  Potential Next steps:
  
    - Expand question database to include multiple options for entry.
    - Expand size of maze and improve the front end graphics.
    - Combine all windows into one main window to eliminate multiple windows.
    - Add more robust save game feature.
    
  NOTE: Not All Code Contained in this repo is mine.
